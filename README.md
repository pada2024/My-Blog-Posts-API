# My-Blog-Posts-API
My rendition of a 2 page website where users can view and input blog posts 

##Goal 
Create a 2 page website that will collect Blog Content and store it

##Motivation
My motivation is to understand JavaScript and learn the fundamentals and concepts of using it on a professional level


##Progress
So far I have the basic functionality and styling setup but am running into trouble storing the data in the local storage. I have been refacturing my code and going over previous lessons to figure out what I am missing. Initially, I was missing some event listeners and event handlers. I plan to continue refactoring and trouble shooting until I get it right. I am learning whart can and will work and was happy to get to the point I am at without any starter code.

##Media

Screen recording of current functionality. While I can capture the Blog Content it is not storing:

I've decided for now to add pseudo code of my outstanding acceptance criteria. I will refactor them to where I believe they shoudld go within my code
