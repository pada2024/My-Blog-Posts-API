# My-Blog-Posts-API
My rendition of a 2 page website where users can view and input blog posts 

##Goal 
Create a 2 page website that will collect Blog Content and store it

##Motivation
My motivation is to understand JavaScript and learn the fundamentals and concepts of using it on a professional level


##Progress
So far I have the basic functionality and styling setup but am running into trouble storing the data in the local storage. I have been refacturing my code and going over previous lessons to figure out what I am missing. Initially, I was missing some event listeners and event handlers. I plan to continue refactoring and trouble shooting until I get it right. I am learning whart can and will work and was happy to get to the point I am at without any starter code.

##Media

Screen recording of current functionality. While I can capture the Blog Content it is not storing:

I've decided for now to add pseudo code of my outstanding acceptance criteria. I will refactor them to where I believe they shoudld go within my code

##Addendum to progress
I thought I had it, but realized I needed more time. I was able to store multiple entries locally but when I added code to store on a separate HML page, it stopped working. I also couldn't figure out how to get my my light and dark toggle to render. This challenge was a bit difficult for me. However, I am very persisent and at least wanted to attempt it, even if I could not complete it.I think after loooking at the code and refactoring it so much I started to lose concepts.

##Conclusion
I did not fully execute the assignment. I a missing the light/dark switch, the 2nd page that should display my blog entries pulled from the local storage, the JSOn array of Blog Posts, the capability of taking a closer look into a single blog entry, along wiith the developer's portfolio.
